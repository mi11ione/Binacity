    Course(index: 4, title: "How does it work with numbers", subtitle: "20 sections - 3 hours", text: "Binary numbers look strange when they are written out directly. This is because the digits' weight increases by powers of 2. \n\nIn a digital numeral, the digit furthest to the right is the ones digit; the next digit to the left is the twos digit; next comes the fours digit, then the eights digit and so on.\n\nThe decimal equivalent of a binary number can be found by summing all the digits. For example, the binary 10101 is equivalent to the decimal 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^4 = 21", image: "mindblownMemoji", background: "Background 2", logo: "mindblownMemoji", height: 130),
